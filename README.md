This repo will eventually contain the data analysis pipeline to transform video data to tracks using Deep Lab Cut. 

Steps we will (most probably) need:
* Identify number of animals per video using RFID files. This will need a matching between RFID time stamps and video time stamps. 
* DLC video to tracks
* Track need to be stiched so that we have consistent animal IDs. Use RFID data to match track IDs to mouse IDs of entering and leaving mice (going forward and backward in time).
* Further post-processing?
*
